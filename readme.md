# React and Middleman app

Skeleton app that allows React to be used on the client side, while Middleman is used on the server side. Perfect for lightweight sides such as blogs. 

Many of the ideas in this repo came from this blog post http://teejayvanslyke.com/adding-react-to-a-middleman-project-with-webpack.html
